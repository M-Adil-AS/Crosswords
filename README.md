# Crosswords
This project was inspired by the Android game Wordscapes. Wordscapes have hundreds of levels but those levels are hardcoded.

In this game, we get a random combination of 6 alphabets to make words from in limited time. Instead of being a hardcoded puzzle, the program generates a dynamic puzzle everytime using words from dictionary in a very short period of time (3 seconds average). Also uploaded its tutorial on my youTube channel.
