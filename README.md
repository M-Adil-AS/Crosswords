A Browser Game I made as a personal project. Also uploaded its tutorial on my youTube channel.

Everytime we get a random combination of 6 alphabets to make words from in limited time. Instead of being a hardcoded puzzle, the program generates a dynamic puzzle everytime using words from dictionary in a very short time (3 seconds average).
